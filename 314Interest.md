My Interest in Software Engineering started with a problem.  A communications set onboard the ship I was serving on stopped working.  One of the database sets that carried a huge group of comms channels and routing tables was completely wiped.  We reached out to the installer / owner of the equipment and asked what we could do.  There was nothing to be done.  The ship had to pull off of a valuable underway, dock, wait for this one person to fly from who knows where and fix the issue.  It was just a computer.  How hard could it be to recreate a database set for the most cutting-edge communications system the Navy was running?

I asked the Captain for a couple of hours before we pulled the plug on our underway.  It couldn’t make the situation worse right?  I examined the still-working database sets, learned the patterns and theorized how they differed from the set that was now missing.  I can fix this.  I spent the day rewriting the database set for an entire group of communications channels from scratch.  It saved our underway, saved our equipment and most importantly, gave me a profound need.  The need to learn what was going on behind the scenes with what was quickly becoming a computerized Navy, and her computerized ships.

Out of this course, I look forward to gaining an understanding of the engineering that goes on behind the scenes of the tasks and computers that we so heavily depend on nowadays.   In my current role, I will benefit greatly from the Agile Project Management curriculum.  I’m not sure what specific skills will be learned, but I know I will be looking for ways to apply them to everyday life.
